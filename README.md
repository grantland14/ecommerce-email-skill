# eCommerce Skills for Claude Code

A collection of 14 AI agent skills built for eCommerce founders and DTC operators. Give Claude deep expertise in email marketing, paid ads, pricing, product launches, buyer psychology, financial analysis, and more — so every conversation starts with expert-level context instead of a blank slate.

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, Claude Code can recognize when you're working on an eCommerce task and apply the right frameworks, templates, and best practices automatically.

Think of each skill as hiring a specialist — except the specialist lives inside Claude and is available 24/7.

## The Brand Guide (Start Here)

The **eCommerce Brand Guide** skill is the foundation. It creates a `.claude/brand-guide.md` file that captures your brand's identity, customer personas, product catalog, voice, positioning, and competitive landscape. Every other skill checks for this file automatically — so you describe your brand once and every skill already knows who you are.

## How Skills Work Together

All skills check for your **Brand Guide** (`.claude/brand-guide.md`) before asking questions. If it exists, Claude already knows your brand, customers, products, and voice — so you skip the repetitive setup and go straight to the work.

Example workflow:

1. **Start with the Brand Guide** — Build your brand context once
2. **Use the CFO skill** — Understand your margins and unit economics
3. **Use the Pricing skill** — Set prices based on your cost structure and market position
4. **Use the Launch skill** — Plan your next product launch across all channels
5. **Use the Email skill** — Write the launch email sequence
6. **Use the Paid Ads skill** — Build the ad campaigns to amplify the launch
7. **Use the Analytics skill** — Measure what worked and reallocate budget

Each skill is standalone, but they're designed to compound when used together.
