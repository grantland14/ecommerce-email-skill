# eCommerce Marketing Analyst Skill for Claude

A marketing analytics expert for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Understand which channels drive revenue, allocate budget based on data, and stop wasting money on marketing that doesn't work.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into an eCommerce analytics specialist who brings clarity to your marketing data. It covers:

- **Metrics that matter** — Three tiers: daily (revenue, AOV, ROAS), weekly (traffic, email, customer split), and monthly (MER, CAC, LTV, cohorts)
- **Attribution** — Practical attribution for DTC: MER, platform ROAS, post-purchase surveys, UTM tracking, and incrementality testing
- **Platform-specific analytics** — How to read Shopify, GA4, Klaviyo, Meta Ads, and Google Ads reports
- **Budget allocation** — Framework for splitting marketing spend across channels based on performance
- **Customer analysis** — New vs. returning revenue split, cohort retention, and LTV by acquisition source
- **Analytics audit** — Checklist for tracking setup, data quality, and reporting gaps
- **Channel performance** — Comparative analysis across all marketing channels
