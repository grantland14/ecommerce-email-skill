# eCommerce Brand Guide Skill for Claude

The central brand context file that powers every other eCommerce skill. Build your brand guide once and every skill reads it automatically — no re-explaining your brand, customers, or positioning.

## What it does

This skill walks you through building a `.claude/brand-guide.md` file that captures your brand's DNA. Once it exists, every other eCommerce skill checks it before asking questions, so Claude already knows your brand when you start working.

The brand guide covers:

- **The Brand** — Mission, founding story, brand personality, tone of voice
- **Customer Personas** — Who buys from you, their motivations, objections, and language
- **Product Catalog** — Your products, pricing, hero SKUs, margins, and differentiation
- **Brand Voice** — How you speak, words you use, words you avoid
- **Messaging & Positioning** — Key messages, positioning statement, tagline
- **Competitive Landscape** — Who you compete with and how you're different
- **Key Dates & Calendar** — Launch dates, sales events, seasonal moments
- **Proof Points** — Reviews, press, certifications, awards

## Installation
