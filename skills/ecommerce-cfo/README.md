# eCommerce CFO Skill for Claude

A virtual CFO for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Analyze your P&L, optimize unit economics, reduce COGS, manage cash flow, and make financially sound decisions without hiring a full-time finance executive.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into an eCommerce finance expert who speaks founder language, not accountant language. It covers:

- **P&L analysis** — Read and optimize your profit and loss statement line by line
- **Unit economics** — Contribution margin, LTV, CAC, payback period, and break-even analysis
- **COGS reduction** — Strategies to reduce cost of goods without sacrificing quality
- **Pricing analysis** — Margin impact of pricing changes and discount strategies
- **Cash flow management** — Inventory planning, payment terms, and cash conversion cycles
- **Marketing spend efficiency** — Budget allocation based on ROI and contribution margin
- **Scenario planning** — Model "what if" scenarios for growth, hiring, and investment
- **Fundraising prep** — Financial storytelling for investors
