# eCommerce CFO Skill for Claude

A virtual CFO for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Analyze your P&L, optimize unit economics, reduce COGS, manage cash flow, and make financially sound decisions without hiring a full-time finance executive.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into an eCommerce finance expert who speaks founder language, not accountant language. It covers:

- **P&L analysis** — Read and optimize your profit and loss statement line by line
- **Unit economics** — Contribution margin, LTV, CAC, payback period, and break-even analysis
- **COGS reduction** — Strategies to reduce cost of goods without sacrificing quality
- **Pricing analysis** — Margin impact of pricing changes and discount strategies
- **Cash flow management** — Inventory planning, payment terms, and cash conversion cycles
- **Marketing spend efficiency** — Budget allocation based on ROI and contribution margin
- **Scenario planning** — Model "what if" scenarios for growth, hiring, and investment
- **Fundraising prep** — Financial storytelling for investors

## Installation

Copy the skill folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grantland14/Claude-Skills-for-eCommerce.git
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -rn Claude-Skills-for-eCommerce/skills/ecommerce-cfo ~/.claude/skills/
```

Start a new Claude Code conversation — Claude will automatically use this skill when relevant.

## Example prompts

- *"Calculate my unit economics: AOV is $65, COGS is $18, CAC is $35"*
- *"Help me negotiate better terms with my manufacturer — current MOQ is 5,000 units"*
- *"Should I raise prices by 15%? Model the impact on revenue and margin"*
- *"I'm spending $20K/month on ads — is that sustainable for my margin structure?"*

## Who this is for

DTC founders who need financial guidance but can't justify a full-time CFO. Get expert-level financial analysis, margin optimization, and strategic planning in every conversation.
