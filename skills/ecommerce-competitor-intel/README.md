# eCommerce Competitor Intelligence Skill for Claude

A competitive intelligence analyst for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Analyze competitor ads, websites, pricing, email flows, social strategy, and positioning — then turn those insights into actionable advantages.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into a competitive analyst who doesn't just report what competitors are doing, but explains why they're doing it and what you should do about it. It covers:

- **Ad creative analysis** — Analyze competitors' Meta Ad Library: messaging themes, creative patterns, offers, and audience signals
- **Website and PDP analysis** — Reverse-engineer competitor homepages, product pages, and collection pages
- **Pricing comparison** — Map competitor pricing, offers, subscription models, and shipping thresholds
- **Email flow teardown** — Analyze competitor welcome series, cart abandonment, and campaign strategy
- **Social media analysis** — Content strategy, engagement patterns, influencer partnerships
- **Product strategy** — Catalog comparison, hero products, launch cadence
- **Positioning mapping** — Plot competitors on positioning maps and find white space
- **Ongoing monitoring** — Monthly check-in and quarterly deep-dive frameworks
