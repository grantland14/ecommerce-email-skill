# eCommerce Competitor Intelligence Skill for Claude

A competitive intelligence analyst for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Analyze competitor ads, websites, pricing, email flows, social strategy, and positioning — then turn those insights into actionable advantages.

- **Pricing comparison** — Map competitor pricing, offers, subscription models, and shipping thresholds
- **Email flow teardown** — Analyze competitor welcome series, cart abandonment, and campaign strategy
- **Social media analysis** — Content strategy, engagement patterns, influencer partnerships
