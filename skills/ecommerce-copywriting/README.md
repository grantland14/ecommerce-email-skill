# eCommerce Copywriting Skill for Claude

An expert eCommerce copywriter built as a Claude skill. Write product descriptions, homepage copy, collection pages, about pages, and landing pages that convert browsers into buyers.

## What it does

- **Product descriptions** — Benefit-driven copy that answers buyer questions and drives add-to-cart
- **Homepage copy** — Hero sections, value props, social proof blocks, and CTAs
- **Collection pages** — Category descriptions that help customers self-select
- **About pages** — Brand stories that build trust and emotional connection
- **Landing pages** — Campaign-specific pages optimized for conversion
- **Copy frameworks** — PAS, AIDA, Before/After/Bridge, and eCommerce-specific structures
