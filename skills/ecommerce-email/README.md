# eCommerce Email Skill for Claude

The complete eCommerce email playbook, built as a Claude skill. Drop it into Claude and get an expert email strategist that knows DTC brands, Klaviyo, and revenue-focused email programs.

## What it does

Instead of prompting Claude from scratch every time, this skill gives Claude deep context on eCommerce email so you can jump straight into the work. It covers:

- **Automated flows** — Welcome series, abandoned cart, browse abandonment, post-purchase, win-back, back in stock, price drop, VIP, birthday, sunset
- **Campaign strategy** — Seasonal calendars, BFCM, product launches, flash sales, content campaigns
- **Segmentation** — RFM, engagement tiers, purchase behavior, product affinity
- **Platform guidance** — Klaviyo-first, with support for Omnisend and Mailchimp
- **Audits** — Full email program audits with gap analysis and prioritized recommendations

## Installation

Copy the skill folder into your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grantland14/Claude-Skills-for-eCommerce.git
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -rn Claude-Skills-for-eCommerce/skills/ecommerce-email ~/.claude/skills/
```

Start a new Claude Code conversation — Claude will automatically use this skill when relevant.

## Example prompts

- *"Audit my Klaviyo setup — I'm doing $80k/month, AOV $65, no post-purchase flow yet"*
- *"Write me an abandoned cart sequence for a skincare brand, 3 emails"*
- *"What segments should I set up first for a new DTC coffee brand?"*
- *"Plan my BFCM campaign calendar for November"*
- *"We're launching a new product next week, what emails do I need?"*

## Who this is for

DTC founders, email marketers, and eCommerce agencies who want Claude to give strategic, platform-aware email advice without having to re-explain the basics every session.
