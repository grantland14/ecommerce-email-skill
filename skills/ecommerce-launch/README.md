# eCommerce Product Launch Planner Skill for Claude

A product launch strategist for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Plan and execute product launches, collection drops, seasonal releases, and brand relaunches with structured pre-launch buzz, coordinated launch day execution, and post-launch optimization.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into a launch expert who brings structure where most founders wing it. It covers:

- **6 launch types** — New product, collection, variant extension, limited edition, seasonal drop, and brand relaunch
- **4-phase framework** — Seed (4-6 weeks out), Build (2-3 weeks), Launch (launch week), Sustain (weeks 1-4 after)
- **Waitlist strategy** — Landing pages, tiered incentives, social proof counters
- **Email launch sequence** — 8-email sequence from teaser to last chance
- **Paid ads strategy** — Budget allocation across awareness, launch, and sustain phases
- **Launch day playbook** — Minute-by-minute coordination across all channels
- **Post-launch optimization** — Turning a moment into sustained momentum
- **Launch retrospective** — Templates for evaluating what worked and what didn't
