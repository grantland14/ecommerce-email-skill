# Ad Copy Templates for eCommerce

Ready-to-use copy formulas for DTC and eCommerce paid advertising. Organized by platform, funnel stage, and ad element. Replace bracketed placeholders with your product details.

---

## Primary Text Formulas

Primary text is the body copy that appears above the image/video in Meta ads, or the main copy block in other platforms. These formulas are designed for eCommerce — selling physical products to consumers.

### Formula 1: The Customer Confession

Opens with a relatable admission that mirrors the reader's experience.

```
I used to [embarrassing/frustrating thing the customer does].

Then I tried [Product] and [specific result].

Now I [positive new behavior/outcome].

[1-line proof point: reviews, awards, or sales number]

[CTA] → [URL]
```

**Example:**
I used to spend 30 minutes every morning fighting with my hair.

Then I tried The Silk Set and my blowouts started lasting 4 days instead of 1.

Now I hit snooze twice and still walk out looking like I tried.

Over 8,000 women made the switch. 4.8 stars.

### Formula 2: The Myth Breaker

Challenges a common belief in your product category. Stops the scroll by creating disagreement.

```
Everyone says [common belief about the product category].

Here's the truth: [contrarian insight that repositions the problem].

That's why we built [Product] — [1-line explanation of how it's different].

[Key proof point]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
Everyone says you need a 10-step skincare routine for clear skin.

Here's the truth: most of those products are canceling each other out.

That's why we built The Simple Three — just cleanser, serum, moisturizer with ingredients that actually play well together.

Dermatologist-formulated. 12,000+ clear skin converts.

### Formula 3: The Quiet Flex

Understated social proof that lets the numbers speak. Works well for premium and mid-range products.

```
[Impressive stat — sales, reviews, or reorder rate].

No paid influencers. No viral moment. Just a [product] that [core benefit].

[1-2 lines of specifics: ingredients, materials, how it works]

See why [number] [people] keep coming back →
```

**Example:**
47,000 jars sold in 11 months.

No paid influencers. No viral moment. Just a body butter that actually absorbs and doesn't leave your sheets greasy.

Shea butter + squalane + ceramides. Fragrance-free. Made in small batches.

See why 47,000 people keep coming back →

---

### Formula 4: The Direct Comparison

Positions your product against the status quo or a common alternative. No need to name competitors — just describe the experience.

```
[Your product] vs. [what they're currently using]:

✓ [Your advantage 1]
✓ [Your advantage 2]
✓ [Your advantage 3]
✗ [What the alternative gets wrong]

[Price/value framing]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
Our dog food vs. kibble from the pet store shelf:

✓ Human-grade ingredients (you could eat it — we dare you)
✓ Portioned for your dog's breed and weight
✓ Delivered fresh to your door every 2 weeks
✗ No mystery "meat meal" or artificial preservatives

Starting at $2.10/day. Less than your morning coffee.

---

### Formula 5: The Micro-Story

A tiny narrative arc in 3-4 lines. Creates an emotional beat that static feature-benefit copy can't match.

```
[Situation setup — 1 line that places the reader in a moment]
[The frustration or realization]
[The product as the turning point]
[The new normal — life after the purchase]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
8pm. You just got the kids to bed. You've got 45 minutes before you're unconscious.

The last thing you want is a skincare routine that feels like homework.

That's why [Product] is one step. Cleanse, treat, moisturize — done in 30 seconds.

Your 45 minutes are yours again.

---

### Formula 6: The Review Spotlight

Leads with a real customer quote, then contextualizes it. Social proof as the primary hook.

```
"[Specific, detailed customer review quote]" — [Name, Location]

[Product] — [1-line description of what it is]

[1 additional proof point: review count, star rating, bestseller status]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
"I've bought this three times now. My husband stole the first one, my sister stole the second. Third time's the charm." — Megan R., Austin TX

The Everywhere Blanket — merino wool, machine washable, sized for the couch and the plane.

4.9 stars from 3,200+ reviews.

---

### Formula 7: The Ingredient/Material Spotlight

For products where what it's made of IS the selling point. Leads with the key ingredient or material and makes it the star.

```
One ingredient changed everything: [Key ingredient/material].

[What it does — in plain language, not science jargon]

We put [specific amount/concentration] in every [product] because [reason].

[Credibility: sourced from, tested by, proven in]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
One ingredient changed everything: bakuchiol.

It does what retinol does — smooths lines, evens tone, firms — without the redness, peeling, or sun sensitivity.

We put 2% bakuchiol in every bottle because your skin shouldn't have to suffer to improve.

Plant-derived. Dermatologist-tested. Safe for pregnancy and sensitive skin.

Try our Bakuchiol Serum →

---

### Formula 8: The Calculator

Breaks down cost-per-use or cost-per-day to reframe the price. Powerful for products that seem expensive upfront but are actually great value over time.

```
$[total price] sounds like a lot.

But here's the math:

[Product] lasts [duration].
That's $[daily/weekly cost] per [day/use/serving].

[Comparison to something they already spend more on]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
$89 sounds like a lot for a face cream.

But here's the math:

One jar lasts 90 days.
That's $0.99/day for your entire skincare routine.

Less than your daily iced coffee. And your skin will actually thank you in the morning.

Start your 90-day jar →

---

### Formula 9: The Seasonal Trigger

Ties the product to a timely moment, season, or event. Creates natural urgency without fake countdown timers.

```
[Seasonal moment or occasion] is [timeframe away].

[Why this product is the right move for this moment — 1-2 lines]

[Offer or incentive tied to the season]

[CTA with deadline]
```

**Example:**
Summer is 6 weeks away.

Your sunscreen shouldn't leave a white cast, smell like a chemical plant, or make your skin break out. Ours doesn't.

Mineral SPF 50. Invisible finish. Reef-safe.

### Formula 10: The Objection Buster

Directly addresses the #1 reason people don't buy. Turns the objection into a selling point.

```
"[Common objection phrased as a customer thought]"

We hear this a lot. Here's the thing:

[Direct response to the objection with proof]

[Additional reassurance: guarantee, free returns, trial offer]

[CTA]
```

**Example:**
"$65 for a candle? Come on."

We hear this a lot. Here's the thing:

This isn't a candle that smells good for 20 minutes then turns to background noise. It's hand-poured with a coconut-soy blend and 12% fragrance load (most candles use 6-8%). It fills a room for 80+ hours.

Don't love it? Full refund. We'll even pay return shipping.

## Platform-Specific Copy Guidelines

### Meta (Facebook + Instagram)

**Character limits:**
- Primary text: 125 characters visible before "See More" (write with truncation in mind — hook must live in those first 125 characters)
- Headline: 40 characters recommended (27 visible on some placements)
- Description: 30 characters recommended (often hidden on mobile)

**Copy rules for Meta:**
- First sentence IS the ad. If it doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters.
- Short paragraphs. One idea per line. Use line breaks liberally.
- Emojis are fine in moderation (1-2 per ad). Don't use them as bullet points for an entire list — it looks spammy.
- Questions as hooks work well — they create an involuntary mental response.
- Avoid ALL CAPS for more than one word. "NEW" is fine. "BIGGEST SALE EVER THIS WEEKEND" is not.
- Don't start with your brand name. Nobody scrolling Instagram cares about your brand name until they care about your product.
- For carousel ads: first card headline is the most important. Make it benefit-driven, not "Product Name."
- For Reels/Stories: text overlay should be readable in 2 seconds. Max 8 words on screen at once.

**Meta ad copy by funnel stage:**

*Prospecting (cold):*
- Lead with the problem or desire, not the product
- Keep it short — 2-4 lines for primary text
- Social proof as credibility (review count, star rating)
- CTA: Shop Now, Learn More, or Shop the Collection

*Retargeting (warm):*
- Acknowledge they've been looking: "Still thinking about it?"
- Lead with the objection answer: "Worried about the fit? Free exchanges."
- Dynamic product copy: Show the product they viewed with specific benefits
- CTA: Complete Your Order, Get Yours, Come Back for [X]% Off

*Retention (existing customers):*
- "Ready for a refill?"
- New product announcements
- Cross-sell: "Loved [Product A]? You'll love [Product B]."
- VIP/loyalty offers
- CTA: Reorder, Try Something New, Shop What's New

---

### Google Ads (Search & Shopping)

**Character limits:**
- Search headlines: 30 characters each (up to 15 headlines)
- Search descriptions: 90 characters each (up to 4 descriptions)
- Shopping: Title pulled from product feed (150 chars max, ~70 visible)
- Shopping: Description pulled from product feed (5,000 chars max)

**Copy rules for Google Search:**
- Include the keyword in at least one headline (relevance = higher Quality Score = lower CPC)
- Headlines should be independent — Google mixes and matches them. Each headline should make sense on its own.
- Use numbers and specifics: "4.9 Stars | 10,000+ Reviews" beats "Highly Rated"
- Include your differentiator: What makes you different from the 4 other Shopping results and 3 other Search results on the same page?
- Descriptions should expand on headlines, not repeat them
- Include price or offer in headlines when competitive
- Use ad extensions aggressively: sitelinks (link to collections, bestsellers, about), callouts (Free Shipping, 30-Day Returns, Made in USA), structured snippets (Types: Serums, Moisturizers, Cleansers)

**Copy rules for Google Shopping feed:**
- Product title is your biggest lever. Front-load with the search term, not your cute product name.
- Bad title: "The Dreamy Pillow"
- Good title: "Memory Foam Pillow for Side Sleepers — Cooling Gel, Queen Size | The Dreamy Pillow by [Brand]"
- Descriptions should be written for humans but include key search terms naturally
- Include material, size, color, and key features in the title when space allows

---

### TikTok

**Character limits:**
- Ad text: 100 characters recommended (300 max, but shorter is better)
- Display name: 40 characters

**Copy rules for TikTok:**
- The ad copy matters far less than the video hook. On TikTok, the creative IS the copy.
- Text overlay in the video should be:
  - Readable in under 2 seconds
  - One idea per frame
  - Casual, internet-native language (not marketing speak)
- Captions (the text below the video): Keep to 1-2 sentences. Include the CTA and offer.
- Hashtags: Use 2-3 relevant hashtags. Don't stuff. #tiktokmademebuyit works if it's authentic.
- Hooks for text overlay in the first frame:
  - "POV: [relatable scenario involving your product]"
  - "The [product] that [bold claim or result]"
  - "I was today years old when I found out about [Product]"
  - "[X] things I wish I knew before buying [product category]"
  - "This is your sign to [do the thing your product enables]"

**TikTok vs. Meta creative:**
- Meta: Can be polished. Can be a clear ad. Users expect ads in their feed.
- TikTok: Must feel like content. The best TikTok ads look like they were made by a friend, not a brand. If it feels like an ad, it gets swiped.

---

### Pinterest

**Character limits:**
- Pin title: 100 characters
- Pin description: 500 characters
- Promoted Pin titles are truncated after ~30-40 characters in the feed

**Copy rules for Pinterest:**
- Pinterest users are in planning and discovery mode. They're saving ideas for later.
- Titles should be descriptive and searchable (Pinterest is a visual search engine):
  - Bad: "Our New Launch"
  - Good: "Organic Cotton Baby Swaddle — Breathable, Newborn to 3 Months"
- Descriptions should include keywords naturally — Pinterest search indexes these
- Include price in the description if your product is competitively priced
- CTA language should be softer — "Save for later," "Shop the look," "Get inspired" work alongside "Shop now"
- Pinterest copy can be longer and more detailed than Meta — users are reading, not scrolling at TikTok speed
- Include seasonal and occasion context: "Perfect for spring nursery decorating" or "Great gift for new parents"

---

## Ad Copy by Product Category

Quick-reference copy angles for common eCommerce categories.

### Beauty & Skincare
- Lead with results and timeframe ("visible difference in 14 days")
- Ingredient transparency is a differentiator
- Before/after language (but be careful with Meta policies on before/after images)
- "What I stopped using" framing (replace 3 products with 1)
- Dermatologist/expert endorsement as proof

### Food & Beverage
- Sensory language — taste, texture, aroma
- Health/nutrition benefits with specific numbers (grams of protein, no added sugar)
- Convenience angle for meal kits and subscriptions
- Source and origin stories (farm, region, process)
- Subscription CTA: "Never run out" or "Fresh to your door every [X]"

### Fashion & Apparel
- Fit is the #1 concern — address it directly
- Show the product on diverse body types
- Material and construction details build quality perception
- Styling versatility: "Wear it 5 ways" or "Desk to dinner"
- Size-inclusive language and easy returns messaging

### Home & Living
- "Before and after" transformation of a space
- Dimensions and scale references (people underestimate/overestimate sizes online)
- Material and durability: "Built to last" with specifics
- Easy-care angle: "Machine washable" / "Wipe clean"
- Room-setting lifestyle imagery in copy descriptions

### Health & Supplements
- Specific dosages and ingredients (transparency builds trust)
- Third-party testing and certifications
- Avoid medical claims — focus on "supports" language
- Subscription/replenishment angle
- Doctor or practitioner endorsement

### Pets
- Speak to the pet owner's love and guilt ("Your dog deserves better than mystery kibble")
- Ingredient quality and sourcing
- Vet approval or formulation
- Happy pet imagery and UGC from pet owners
- Subscription with automatic delivery

### Kids & Baby
- Safety-first messaging (certifications, materials, testing)
- Parent's life improvement angle (not just baby benefit)
- Age/stage-specific targeting
- Gift-giving context for non-parent buyers
- Durability and longevity (grows with them, machine washable)

## Copy Testing Cheat Sheet

### What to A/B Test First (in priority order)

1. **Hook / first line** — Biggest impact on whether anyone reads the rest. Test 3-5 different opening angles against each other.

2. **Offer framing** — "20% off" vs. "$12 off" vs. "Free shipping" vs. "Buy 2, get 1 free." Same economic value, wildly different response rates depending on your audience and price point.

3. **Social proof type** — Star rating vs. review quote vs. "X sold" vs. press mention. Different proof resonates with different audiences.

4. **Copy length** — Short (2-3 lines) vs. medium (5-7 lines) vs. long (10+ lines). There's no universal winner — it depends on your product complexity and price point.

5. **CTA text** — "Shop Now" vs. "Get Yours" vs. "Try Risk-Free." Small change, often measurable impact.

6. **Headline** — Test benefit-first vs. curiosity vs. social proof headlines.

### How to Read Test Results

- **Need 50+ conversions per variant** for statistical significance on purchase-optimized campaigns
- **Give tests 5-7 days** minimum before calling a winner (day-of-week effects are real)
- **Look at ROAS, not just CTR.** A high-CTR ad that attracts non-buyers is worse than a lower-CTR ad that attracts purchasers.
- **Iterate on winners.** When Variation B wins, don't just run it forever. Create Variations C, D, and E that iterate on what made B work.
