# eCommerce Product Pricing Strategy Skill for Claude

A pricing strategist for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Set profitable prices, design discount structures, build subscription tiers, architect bundles, and test pricing changes that maximize revenue without sacrificing brand value.

This skill turns Claude into a pricing expert who understands that pricing is the single most powerful profit lever in eCommerce. It covers:

- **Pricing psychology** — Charm pricing, anchoring, the Rule of 100, precise pricing, per-use framing
- **Discount strategy** — The discount spectrum from least to most brand-diluting, with rules and calendars
- **Bundle architecture** — Routine bundles, starter kits, stock-up packs, gift sets, and decoy pricing
- **Subscription pricing** — Discount levels, tiered models, build-your-box, and key metrics
- **Price testing** — A/B tests, sequential tests, and what to measure beyond conversion rate
- **Price increases** — When to raise, how to communicate, and tactics for minimizing churn
- **BFCM pricing** — Seasonal discount strategies that don't destroy your brand
