## BFCM Pricing Strategy

### Tiered Approach
- **VIP early access (3 days before):** 25-30% off — rewards best customers
- **General sale (Black Friday):** 20-25% off
- **Cyber Monday:** Different offer — bundles, free gifts, or flash deals
- **Extended (Tue-Wed):** "Last chance" at 15-20% off

### Bundle-First Approach
Instead of sitewide discounts, create exclusive BFCM bundles at 20-30% savings vs. buying individually. Protects individual product pricing while delivering value.

### Gift-With-Purchase Approach
Full-price products + limited-edition free gift (worth $15-30) on orders over a threshold. Protects pricing entirely while creating urgency around the exclusive gift.

| Free gift with first order | Premium brands | 15-25% |

Competitor Pricing Tracker — Review Monthly

| Product    | Your Price | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C | Your Position |
|------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| [SKU 1]    | $XX       | $XX    | $XX    | $XX    | Premium       |

Note competitor price changes and timing.
```

### How to Respond to Competitor Price Changes

**Competitor drops prices:** Don't automatically match. Ask: Why? Does it affect your conversion rate? Can you differentiate on value instead?

**Competitor raises prices:** Opportunity — follow for more margin, or hold for better value position.

**New low-price entrant:** Compete on value, not price. Strengthen brand story, social proof, quality, and experience.

## Price Test Measurement Framework

### Primary Metrics
```
Revenue per visitor = Price × Conversion Rate

Example:
Price A ($45): 3.2% CVR = $1.44 revenue/visitor
Price B ($55): 2.5% CVR = $1.38 revenue/visitor
Price C ($39): 4.1% CVR = $1.60 revenue/visitor

Winner by RPV: Price C
But also consider: Does Price C attract the right customers? What's the LTV?
```

### Full Measurement Checklist
- Revenue per visitor (Price × CVR)
- Gross profit per visitor (RPV × Gross Margin %)
- AOV (does price change affect add-on behavior?)
- Add-to-cart rate
- Cart abandonment rate
- Return rate (higher prices sometimes = lower returns)
- Customer satisfaction
- Repeat purchase rate (do they come back?)

### Maximum Sustainable Discount Calculator
```
Maximum Discount = Gross Margin - Required Operating Margin

Example:
Gross margin: 75%
Required margin (marketing + fulfillment + overhead + profit): 40%
Maximum sustainable discount: 35%

At various discounts:
Full price: 75% gross margin
10% off: 65% gross margin
20% off: 55% gross margin
30% off: 45% gross margin
35% off: 40% gross margin (break-even)
```
