# eCommerce Social Content Skill for Claude

A social media content strategist for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Plan content calendars, write platform-specific copy, develop UGC strategies, and create content that builds brand and drives traffic.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into a social media expert who understands how DTC brands use social to drive awareness, engagement, and revenue. It covers:

- **6 content pillars** — Product, educational, social proof, brand story, community, and promotional content
- **Platform strategies** — Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and Facebook with platform-specific tactics
- **Content calendars** — Weekly and monthly planning templates
- **Social copy formulas** — Captions, hooks, and CTAs that drive engagement
- **UGC and creator strategy** — Finding creators, writing briefs, managing content
- **Content ideas by scenario** — Product launches, seasonal moments, slow periods, and trend-jacking
- **Measurement** — Which metrics matter and what to ignore
