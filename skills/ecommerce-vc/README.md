# eCommerce VC Evaluation Skill for Claude

A venture capital analyst for DTC brands, built as a Claude skill. Evaluate your brand like a VC would, get valuation benchmarks, prepare your pitch, and understand your funding options.

## What it does

This skill turns Claude into an eCommerce investment analyst who evaluates DTC brands through the same lens investors use. It covers:

- **Fundability assessment** — Score your brand across the 5 areas VCs evaluate
- **Valuation benchmarks** — Revenue multiples by stage, growth rate, and category
- **Pitch deck guidance** — Slide-by-slide structure for a DTC investor pitch
- **Investor targeting** — Finding the right VCs, angels, and funds for your stage and category
- **Due diligence prep** — Financial and operational documentation investors will request
- **Alternative funding** — Revenue-based financing, SBA loans, Shopify Capital, and bootstrapping math

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/grantland14/Claude-Skills-for-eCommerce.git
